# Gameloop {#gameloop}

This is it! We've finally reached the point where by the end of the chapter we'll actually have stuff on the screen! Before we get too excited about it lets wind down and ponder a minute about...

## What Is a Game Again?

With our newly understood concepts about game loops and gaming in general lets cut stuff from a game until we're left with what is the essence of a game.

Games these days have title screens, intro animations, tutorial levels, infinite option screens, leaderboards and many other things that if we cut out we're not left without a game. If you go back in time into the 90s, you could pick a handheld game not unlike Tetris that when powered on would drop you straight into the game. No fancy options, no tutorial levels, no intro stuff, just the actual game.

This game play part is what we're calling the game loop. Its the piece of your game that picks the input from the user, calculates what happens in the game world and displays it to the player. This continuous loop of picking input, simulating the world and displaying it is the heartbeat of a game. It is what makes it alive. You don't need to focus on the fancy stuff mentioned above, you need to focus on this heartbeat and the rest will follow.

In this chapter we're going to build part of this beating meachinism. We're going to focus on the simulating the world and displaying part and leave player input to its own chapter. At the end of this chapter, our game will be alive and moving.
