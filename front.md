## Warning

![Early Releases Change Often](images/originals/early.png)

**This is a work in progress. You're handling an early release of an unfinished book.**

Pick a bucket of LEGO pieces and throw them randomly on the floor. Now, blindfold yourself, spin 20 times and start walking around. This is the kind of danger you're facing here. Content will change and feedback is more than welcome.

This release is so early that its 5:15 AM in here and I am still writing...

**You've been warned!**

## Acknowledgments

To my wife Lili, the best wife in the world!

To Mozilla for always believing in us, for keeping the web open and free and for always placing the user first!

To the Brazilian Mozilla Community for receiving me so well and being just awesome!

To my GSoC mentor Soledad Penades, the Mozilla Apps Team, the Mozilla Tech Evangelists and Dev Engagement teams for being more than awesome!

To Google for the Google Summer of Code 2014! This program is FANTASTIC.


## This book is in perpetual beta

My plan is to update this book often, expanding its contents and revising the text as issues are found by readers. Since some APIs are still being implemented by Firefox OS, you will want to make sure you're reading an up-to-date version of this book. Also as time goes by after the initial release of this book I will be able to explore more aspects of game making and thus make this a more complete resource

## Me, myself, and I

In this book you will find many parts where I express my personal opinion and make decisions that may be different from what other programmers would do - particularly if it helps explain an idea more easily. I will always try to make it clear and explain my reasoning when I am giving my opinion. Anyway, if there is an error in what I am saying, I will revise the text and update the book. See the Feedback & Pull Requests section for more information.

## Want to know more about Firefox OS Dev?

This book is targeted at Game Development but there are other books and resources for those wanting to know more about Firefox OS Development such as:

* [The Quick Guide for Firefox OS Development](https://leanpub.com/quickguidefirefoxosdevelopment/): a free and open source sibling to this book but focused on app development. If you're reading this book you probably will like that one too.
* [Firefox OS Developer Hub](https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers): The developer hub on Firefox Marketplace contains a lot of information and resources about creating Firefox OS applications.
* [The Firefox OS Zone on Mozilla Developers Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS): MDN is probably one of the most important developer resource online focused on web technologies. Its a free and open source treasure trove of documentation, samples and articles. This link is for the Firefox OS zone that aggregates links related to this new platform.
* [Beginning Firefox OS HTML5 Game Programming](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IZUYIGO): Bob Thulfram has released this awesome book on Amazon. If you want more resources about Game Development on Firefox OS you need to check this one out.
* [Firefox OS Gaming Blog](http://firefoxosgaming.blogspot.co.uk/): Bob Thulframs blog about Firefox OS Gaming. After you start creating games you will probably see your creations featured here :-)

There is now a site that lists all known books related to Firefox OS at [http://firefoxosbooks.org](http://firefoxosbooks.org).

## How this book came to be

This book is a sibling to the [Quick Guide for Firefox OS Development](https://leanpub.com/quickguidefirefoxosdevelopment/) which is a similar book that cover making apps for Firefox OS. After releasing that book and talking to many people, I though we needed a similar resource targeting game development since that is often one of the overlooked aspects of developer documentation. This book shares some content with the quick guide.

I kept that idea on the back burner for when I had time to implement it but the new GSoC 2014 was upon us and I decided to submit this as a project. Being a GSoC student is wonderful and enables me to dedicate time to this type of effort without the peril of not paying my monthly bills. Its a fantastic program that empowers us students to deliver quality open source material that otherwise would take too long to create.
